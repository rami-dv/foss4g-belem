# WORKSHOPS

## Deadlines
**CFP for Submission of workshop**: From May 8 to July 12, 2024.

**Workshop Evaluation**: From July 22 to 31, 2024.

**Full FOSS4G 2022 program**: September 1, 2024.

Workshops are hands-on sessions where attendees can learn a specific FOSS4G software, package, or library for problem-solving.

The workshops showcase current and emerging FOSS4G technologies, encourage skills development, and provide direct interaction between our OSGeo community and the public who wish to acquire new skills.

Each workshop can last for 2 or 4 hours. Everything happens in a hands-on manner, and everyone is expected to use their own computer.

## Submit a workshop
When submitting a workshop, use the abstract to clarify the scope and content. It is in your and your attendees' best interest to ensure your objectives are well-defined. Include the list of topics you want to cover and links to data and tutorials that will be used to familiarize attendees with the topic.

You will be asked to indicate the level 1-4 (from beginner to very advanced) required knowledge that attendees should have.

The workshops will be held on December 2nd and 3rd.
